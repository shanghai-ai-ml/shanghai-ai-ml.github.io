## About

MSRA Shanghai AI/ML Group focuses on machine learning and its applications. More specifically, we are interested to the following directions.

### AI and brain

We are interested to the interdisciplinary study between AI and brain, aiming to use AI to help better understand the brain and leverage the insights to help improve AI and brain health. 

- **Brain-inspired AI**, inluding spiking neural networks, brain-inspired neural network architectures and brain-inspired algirithms, etc.
- **Brain-computer interface**, focusing on EEG signal understanding and non-invasive EEG-based BCI applications.

### AI and Healthcare

We are interested to applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques into real-world healthcare problems, aiming to use AI to improve the productivity of doctors and medical researchers.

- **AI-aided speech therapy**, in which we propose deep learning-based algorithms to detect and estimate hyper-nasality for patients with cleft lip and palate.
- **AI-based drug discovery**, in which we propose new drug combination algorithms for more effective treatment of various cancers and develop new diffusion algorithms for more flexible molecule generation.
- **Medical image analysis**, in which we improve the performance of ultrasound localization microscopy in medical unltrasound video, further pusing its performance towards real-world applications, and develop effective pretraining and finetuning techniques for medical image foundation models.
