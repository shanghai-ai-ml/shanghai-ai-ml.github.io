## Overview

In this project, we are focused on explainable machine learning to help people better understand AI models and to enhance human learning by unveiling the hidden knowledge within today's advanced AI systems.

- **Explainable machine learning**: We propose new techniques for understanding time series models, graph neural networks, and computer vision models.
- **AI-aided knowledge discovery and learning**: We leverage cutting-edge AI models to facilitate human learning and to discover new knowledge from AI models.
